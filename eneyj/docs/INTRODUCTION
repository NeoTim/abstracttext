eneyj allows to specify functions, literals, and implementations for the
specified functions.

Currently, the best way to explore and get to know eneyj is through the command
line interface. Welcome to that path!

The command line interface itself has a few commands to help you. Type in
> .help commands
for a list, and when you're interested in a specific command, say in the .label
command, type
> .help label

Besides that, you can type Z expressions directly in the command line (using
the tab key for autocompletion) and, per default, the Z expression will be
validated, evaluated, and then the result linearized. You can control for each
of those steps whether it should be performed or not using the commands
.validation, .evaluation, and .linearize.
